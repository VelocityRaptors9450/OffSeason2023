6) Now this is simple, Here are some good things to remember while coding 

* All controller based code goes in RobotContainer.

* Don't add your drivetrain as an instance directly into your Robot.java,
instead go through your Container, otherwise, there can be 2 instances of the same object, that is not good and can result in an error.

* Subsystems are used to store methods for specific parts of the robot 
(the drivetrain, arm, and shooter are all examples of different parts of the robot that require their own subsystems).

* Use commands to organize multiple methods to into a larger system for a specific job.

* Use comments often to explain a body of code especially when working with others.

Now you're done with the course, you can now test out more stuff with the Romi robot or move onto one of your team's robots.
Have fun and keep coding!
