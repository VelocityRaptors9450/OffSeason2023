    //Use the PID calculate function to calculate the speed needed
    //pid.calculate( encodervalue(only get one side using a drive_function), double distance_needed )
    //Then apply that speed to both wheels using the drive.go function.
    // I also suggest using encoders to print out the distance to see how accurate you are.

    /*4) Now that you have done this, run the program and see if it goes 12 inches before stopping
    Now that you see that it DIDN'T go 12 inches, you have to go back to the PID values and change the values.
    You will have to keep doing this until it is really close to 12 inches and doesn't oscillate much, (I recommend printing the encoder values)
    After you get it close CONSISTENTLY, check if it is at max 0.1 inches off.
    
    One thing you should know before moving on though is that you will soon have to learn feadForwards,
    these are used to counteract external forces like friction that may hurt PIDs performance.
    It won't be taught in this course, but I highly recommend researching into it*/
