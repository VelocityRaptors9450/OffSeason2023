Hello there,
This is a Romi beginner program that will hopefully help you understands the basics of programing a robot.
This program is in java and it is suggested to know the basics of java. We will you a coding library called WPILIB to code the Romi (you should aready have the library  installed). You will hop through files and learn stuff from comments and links throughout the file.
Before though you will have to know a few things in java:
* variables
* instance methods
* basic knowledge of loops
* methods and parameters
this is the order of which you will learn things:
- 1 * How to set power to motors and creating methods

- 2 * How to get create objects and tranfer methods from one file to another 
    - You will also quickly lear how to run programs on the Romi

- 3 * How to use controllers (will you a xbox library, but should adapt to almost every other controller)

- 4 * PIDS

- 5 * Commands

- 6 * Good habits and organization

go to RomiDrivetrain.java to start the program.























Now this is simple, Here are some good habits you should follow
* all controller stuff go in RobotContainer 
* Don't add your drivetrain as a instice directly into your Robot.java, instead go through your Container

Now your done
