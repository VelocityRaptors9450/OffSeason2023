## Romi curriculum READ.md  
Hello there,  
This is a Romi beginner program that will hopefully help you understand the basics of programming a robot.  
This program is in Java and it is suggested to know the basics of Java. We will you a coding library called WPILib to code the Romi  
(you should already have the library installed and if you don't, follow this [WPILIB install guide](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)). You will hop through files and learn stuff from comments and links throughout the file.  
Before though you will have to know a few things in Java.   
(if you don't know any of these things, then watch the video using the links next to the concept):  
* [Variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so1iUWaLmKA)  
* [if statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY03bt_0JQI) and [logical operators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=919IUhotDCo)
* [Basic knowledge of loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6gmQaTMTtM)
* [Methods and parameters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5p_SUfi710)

This is the order in which you will learn things:
1) How to set the power to motors and create methods

2) How to create objects and transfer methods from one file to another 
    - 1) You will also quickly learn how to run programs on the Romi

3) How to use controllers (will you use the Xbox library created by WPILIB, but this library should adapt to almost every other controller)

4) PIDS

5) Commands

6) Good habits and organization
  
Go to RomiDrivetrain.java to start the program. (Use the file path below if you need help):
