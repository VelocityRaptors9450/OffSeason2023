## Romi curriculum READ.md  
Hello there,  
This is a Romi beginner program that will hopefully help you understand the basics of programming a robot.  
This is the order in which you will learn the concepts of WPILIB and robotics:
1) How to set the power to motors and create methods

2) How to create objects and transfer methods from one file to another 
    - 1) You will also quickly learn how to run programs on the Romi

3) How to use controllers (will you use the Xbox library created by WPILIB, but this library should adapt to almost every other controller)

4) PIDS

5) Commands

6) Good habits and organization
