6) Now this is simple, Here are some good habits you should follow
* All controller stuff goes in RobotContainer.
* Don't add your drivetrain as an instance directly into your Robot.java, instead go through your Container, otherwise, there can be 2 instances of the same object, that is not good.

Now you're done with the course, you can now test out more stuff with the Romi robot or move on to your team's competition bot.
Have fun and keep coding!
